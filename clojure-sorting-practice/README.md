## Clojure Sorting Practice

Work in progress.  Reviewing sorting algorithms by implementing them in Clojure.  Basic algorithms mostly taken from (Introduction to Algorithms)[http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms].

Very rough, not intended for production, use at your own risk, etc. etc.

Comments welcome, in particular stuff like "it would be more efficient to use this kind of Clojure data structure here vs. the vector..." or "you can optimize your heapsort if you do X in your max-heapify function..."

## Usage

You can run all sorts in a repl with `do-all-sorts`, or one-by-one (`do-heap-sort`, etc...).
